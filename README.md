- Make sure you have Node installed using NVM.
- Make sure you have Git installed.
- Make sure you have GitHub configured (preferably for CLI use).
- Using Terminal, navigate to your projects folder.

# Steps:

- **Segment 1.0: Your First View:**
    - Identify entry point into the React app.
    - Render react in index.js.
    - Create first React component, "App".
        - This component is the parent component of all other components.
            - Note that, as written, this component is a pure function (rather than declared as a React component class).
        - It will also contain the router.
